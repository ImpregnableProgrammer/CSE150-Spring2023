# Lab 3 - Openflow Firewall in Python
In this lab, we implement a firewall in Python while following the OpenFlow protocol for software defined networking (SDN) using the POX library. The controller for the network is defined in `lab3controller.py` and the outputs of various commands in MiniNet for the four-host network are given in `lab3.pdf`. The file you're currently reading is `README.md`.
